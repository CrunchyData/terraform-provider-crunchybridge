# crunchybridge Provider

This provider allows [Crunchy Bridge](https://crunchybridge.com) users to interact with the Crunchy Bridge platform API using Terraform.

To get started, log in to Crunchy Bridge and visit [Account Settings](https://crunchybridge.com/account) to obtain an API Key for configuring the provider as shown below.

The example usage below assumes that sensitive data fields are defined in their own files, like `variables.tf` to define the variable names and `terraform.tfvars` for their values.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    crunchybridge = {
      source  = "CrunchyData/crunchybridge"
      version = "0.2.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "crunchybridge" {
  application_id     = var.api_key
  application_secret = var.api_secret
}
```

## Schema

### Required

### Optional

- `application_id` (String) The application id component of the Crunchy Bridge API key. (deprecated)
- `bridgeapi_url` (String) The API URL for the Crunchy Bridge platform API. Most users should not need to change this value.
